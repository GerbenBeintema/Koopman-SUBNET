Installation
============

You can use any python distribution but I recommend using anaconda for it reduces the number of installation complications to almost zero. 

After installing anaconda (adding to path is not necessary) you can open the "anaconda promp" or "anaconda cmd" and type the following commands to install deepSI

.. code:: sh

    conda install torch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c torch 
    conda install -c anaconda git
    pip install git+git://github.com/GerbenBeintema/deepSI@master

(optional; setup an anaconda environment)

To open a jupyter notebook you can use the anaconda navigator or type "jupyter notebook" in the address bar of directory you want to start or open a notebook.
